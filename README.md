## Resolution
First I examined the dataset with python to see if any data was duplicated or missing and no duplications or missing data. Nex I created bar charts to see if the amount purchased depended on the location. The location does not correlate to purchase amount. Next i used a barchart to see which categorys were the most popular, clothing and accessories are the most popular. Then I found men make more purchases than women. After that I created a pie chart show the percentage of order of men and women to better show that men hold 68% of the orders vs women who hold 32%.
